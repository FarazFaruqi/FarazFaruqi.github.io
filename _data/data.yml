    title: Research Statement
    summary: |
     Hey! Faraz Faruqi here. 
     
     I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am working with [Prof. Stefanie Mueller](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital fabrication and machine learning for HCI. The fundamental aim of my research is to design sociable, intelligent and interactive technologies that amplify human ability to realize imagination, motivate self-reliance and enhance creative expression. 
     
     Prior to MIT, I have worked in pioneering research labs at CMU, Pittsburgh and IIIT Hyderabad, with specializations ranging from embodied conversational agents to natural language processing. As an undergraduate research student, I collaborated with graduate and post-graduate researchers in finding solutions to problems ranging from creating virtual collaborative agents to elicit curiosity for science in young children, to creating deep learning systems for classifying and generating humorous texts.

#           -  **Ecosytem for Slicing:** Designed a system that reverses the traditional 3D printing workflow 
#          and allows exploration of multiple prototyping options simultaneously. 
#          - Using a popular slicing software, created a parallel slicing system that instantiated #in the cloud,
#           an online storage system to reuse previously processed results, and a desktop and web-# based UI to explore the results.

#            - **Identification using 3D Print Markers:** Collaborated in developing a novel method to identify 3D printed objects
#            by utilizing the unique patterns created by modifying the slicing parameters during the 3D printing process.
#            - Developed an Acoustic detection system that detects the sound created by scratching the surface of 3D models,
#             analyzes its frequency spectrum to extract MFCC features and classifies the correct class of slicing setting.

#          - **Sensing Curiosity in Play and Responding:** Developed an intelligent virtual child as a peer collaborator to study
#           behavior and evoke curiosity in a multiparty game called Outbreak.
#          -  Designed a model to dynamically extract optimal audio signal from multiple sources, perform Automatic Speech Recognition, 
#          and convert the unstructured speech to a knowledge representation.
#          -  Created a Restricted Wizard-of-Oz system to efficiently detect and annotate conversational behaviors shown by children while 
#          playing the game. The data generated from the study was used to analyse the frequency of behaviors and the various dependencies among them.

#          - **Semantic Analysis of Humor in English Language:** Created a dataset of 800,000 humor and non-humor sentences extracted 
#          from social media websites and other web-based sources.
#          - Created an Attention-based LSTM model to classify sentences as humorous or non-humorous.
#          - **Denormalized Text Generator:** Designed an algorithm to generate code-mixed data from a parallel corpora of English 
#          and Hindi using Linguistic Features.
#          -  Developed a text-generator that used frequency as a metric to generate bilingual text with most common words of each language.

    title: Research Statement
    summary: I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am working with [Prof. Stefanie Mueller](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital fabrication and machine learning for HCI. I work on developing software and hardware tools that leverage existing data as knowledge sources and use machine learning to facilitate augmented human - machine interaction.  As an HCI researcher, I seek to design enhanced systems that will afford a more natural and customizable interaction for users with their environments, expand the utility of the customized objects created, and make process of low-cost personal fabrication reproducible. <br> <br>
     I also participate in several community leadership, and teaching programs at MIT. I am a co-instructor at the [Brave Behind Bars](http://bravebehindbars.org/), a university-accredited computer science and self-efficacy program for incarcerated individuals, with the goal of teaching them technical skills for career-readiness post-release. I was a co-instructor and Teaching Assistant for the [Engineering Interactive Technologies (Fall 2021)](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/classes/2021-fall-6810/6810-engineering-interactive-technologies.html) class at MIT, which taught skills required to build cutting-edge hardware and software to undergraduate students at MIT. This year, I also serve on the [ACM CHI 2023 Conference Organizing Committee](https://chi2023.acm.org/organizing/organizing-committee/) as an Assistant to the Paper Chairs. ACM CHI is the premier conference in Human-Computer Interaction, and I am facilitating the Paper Chairs in several administrative tasks of organizing the conference. <br> <br> 
     Before joining as a PhD student at MIT, I worked with [Prof. Sriram Subramanian](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-groups/multi-sensory-devices/) at UCL, London as a visiting student, where we worked on visualizing 3D objects with acoustic levitation. As an undergraduate research student, I briefly worked at HCI Institute, CMU with [Prof. Justine Cassell](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/justine-cassell) on a project involving creating virtual collaborative agents to elicit curiosity for science in young students through collaborative games.

    title: Research Statement
    summary: I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am working with [Prof. Stefanie Mueller](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital fabrication and machine learning for HCI. Specifically, I work on developing software and hardware tools that leverage existing data as knowledge sources and use machine learning to facilitate augmented human - machine interaction. 
     Before joining as a PhD student at MIT, I worked with [Prof. Sriram Subramanian](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-groups/multi-sensory-devices/) at UCL, London as a visiting student, where we worked on visualizing 3D objects with acoustic levitation. As an undergraduate research student, I briefly worked at HCI Institute, CMU with [Prof. Justine Cassell](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/justine-cassell) on a project involving creating virtual collaborative agents to elicit curiosity for science in young students through collaborative games.

#           -  **Ecosytem for Slicing:** Designed a system that reverses the traditional 3D printing workflow 
#          and allows exploration of multiple prototyping options simultaneously. 
#          - Using a popular slicing software, created a parallel slicing system that instantiated #in the cloud,
#           an online storage system to reuse previously processed results, and a desktop and web-# based UI to explore the results.

#          - **Sensing Curiosity in Play and Responding:** Developed an intelligent virtual child as a peer collaborator to study
#           behavior and evoke curiosity in a multiparty game called Outbreak.
#          -  Designed a model to dynamically extract optimal audio signal from multiple sources, perform Automatic Speech Recognition, 
#          and convert the unstructured speech to a knowledge representation.
#          -  Created a Restricted Wizard-of-Oz system to efficiently detect and annotate conversational behaviors shown by children while 
#          playing the game. The data generated from the study was used to analyse the frequency of behaviors and the various dependencies among them.
